# Cache Implementations with Java Collections

Types of Caches:
* First-in-First-Out (FIFO) - first item that was cached is the first item to be evicted when cache is full
* Least Frequenctly Used (LFU) - item that has the lowest amounts of look-ups is evicted when cache is full
* Least Recently Used (LRU): item that is rarely looked-up is evicted when cache is full
